"""Load hydrated Reddit comments/posts from the corpus repo.

Synthesis works against the post-triage subset already persisted by the
hydration stage. This module is the one boundary between the synthesis core and
storage: every other synthesis module operates on the in-memory `LoadedComment`
/ `LoadedPost` shapes produced here.

We never keep `[deleted]` / `[removed]` / empty bodies — synthesis ranking on
those is meaningless and they'd just chew up LLM tokens.

PORT CHANGE (from clique-research-api): the source read Supabase tables directly
with a manual 200-id IN-chunk loop. Here we read through
`deps.corpus.get_posts(...)` / `deps.corpus.get_comments_for_posts(...)`, which
return contract `RedditPost` / `RedditComment` and already paginate to
exhaustion — so the manual `_ID_CHUNK` chunking is dropped. The contract rows
are MAPPED to the synthesis-local shapes: `RedditComment.score` →
`LoadedComment.upvotes`, `.permalink` → `permalink`. Posts have no `permalink`
on the contract, so `LoadedPost.permalink` is sourced from `RedditPost.url`.
