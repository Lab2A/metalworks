"""Site contract — the Pillar E (Marketing Website) output.

A :class:`MarketingSite` turns a
:class:`~metalworks.contract.research.DemandReport`'s top demand clusters into a
handful of marketing-copy sections, each of which either ships a VERBATIM
fragment of a real Reddit quote (with a resolvable
:class:`~metalworks.contract.evidence.EvidenceRef`) or carries claim-free
connective copy with no refs at all.

Honesty contract (the no-quote-no-section gate, the same spine the demand
report and positioning brief use):
- A claim-bearing section's ``copy`` MUST contain a fragment that exact-matches
  a real ``QuoteCitation.text`` in its source cluster. That fragment is the
  load-bearing claim; the section ships ``provenance="verbatim"`` with one
  ``EvidenceRef(kind="quote")`` resolving against the source report's
  ``evidence``. A section whose fragment matches nothing — or that carries no
  ref — is DROPPED at assembly, never shipped on trust.
- Connective copy (the transitions the LLM may add between verbatim sections)
  ships ``provenance="connective"`` with ZERO refs and MUST be claim-free: no
  numbers, no superlatives. It is glue, not evidence.
- ``derived`` is reserved for future computed-but-sourceless copy; the current
  builder only emits ``verbatim`` and ``connective``.

This is the stable shape ``build_marketing_site(...)`` returns; the demand
report's evidence list is what its ``EvidenceRef``s resolve against (by
``EvidenceRecord.id``). ``partial`` + ``caveat`` carry the honesty signal when
synthesis is unavailable.
